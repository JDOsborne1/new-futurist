    <div class="article-content">
      <p>This is the site for the Futurist Voters Association. This is an open association of likeminded voters, who feel that short-termism is a chronic issue in our political system, and are looking for measures to counter it, and support lasting and long-sighted change.</p>
<p>In its current iteration, the site is a:</p>
<ul>
<li>blog, which contains articles on the early founding of the association, and our plans moving forwards
and</li>
<li>dashboard, which contains a set of graphics tracking some key long term issues, which are both an example of the failings of short-termism, and our key objectives to repair with our efforts.</li>
</ul>
<p>In time we plan to include a some interactive tools, which can help visitors explore some of the above issues, which are often complex and have multiple dimensions over eras and between regions.</p>
<p>We also intend to include forms and mailing lists, where you can contribute information which you have good exposure too and in turn that information becomes accessible to others, contributing to the stories we are building about some worrying trends in our world, and helping us keep track of the good work being done to combat them.</p>
