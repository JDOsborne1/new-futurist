      <description>This is a quick introductory post to explain the purpose of this site, and to provide some idea of what to expect in the (hopefully) not too distant future….
Why?Why does this site exist? It exists as an attempt to introduce a greater factor of futurist thinking to our lives. It has long been a conclusion of mine, and others I’ve held conversations with, that as a quirk of both human nature and the structure of our society, we are often inappropriately consumed with the short term aspects of life and politics.</description>
